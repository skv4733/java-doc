Come and become the first fans of the official account? It will certainly not disappoint your expectations.

## Why choose an official account?

The **original protection function** of the WeChat official account is better, and the content is more convenient to read.

All subsequent original articles of mine will be published on the WeChat public account "Doocs Open Source Community" as soon as possible. If other official account owners want to reprint the content, please send a message to explain to me at the official account chat window, or directly add my personal WeChat (YLB0109) to communicate.

## What is the positioning of the official account?

-**High-quality content**: Do not copy and paste some articles from the Internet at will, even if it is a reprinted technical article, you must ensure the quality.
-**Regular update**: Try to output 1-2 articles per week to ensure a certain update frequency.
