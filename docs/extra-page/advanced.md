> The wounded get healed, the struggling get the exit<br>> _Let those who hurt heal, let those who struggle find hope_.

```
It's time to say goodbye
Pack some happiness with your luggage

The front is shrouded in dark clouds
The pull in the heart, the trapped beast is roaring

Faint silence
Reveal a bit of bitterness
Hope you won't get hurt again
Stop falling asleep with tears

Tortuous world
The answer is not necessarily absolute
The wound is fierce because of love
Let's advance synchronously

The power of rebirth comes from the true self
Defeat your respectable opponent yeah~

Perseverance is my all
Reaching the vastness of my heart yeah~

There is something to be advanced
Regretful, advanced
Can't let go, the advanced yeah~

The light of the sanctuary
Guide the direction oh~

Surpassed the catastrophe
The dawn is shining oh~

Hope was shattered by the struggle
Nothing to ask for and freedom

A lonely hero against the wind
I want to park too, but I canâ€™t say it

Faint silence
Reveal a bit of bitterness
Hope you won't get hurt again
Stop falling asleep with tears

Tortuous world
The answer is not necessarily absolute
The wound is fierce because of love
Let's advance synchronously

The power of rebirth comes from the true self
Defeat your respectable opponent yeah~

Perseverance is my all
Reaching the vastness of my heart yeah~

There is something to be advanced
Regretful, advanced
Can't let go, the advanced yeah~

The light of the sanctuary
Guide the direction oh~

Surpassed the catastrophe
The dawn is shining oh~
